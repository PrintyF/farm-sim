# Genetic AI Simulation Tool

This project is an **Angular application** designed to simulate a population of agents that evolve over time, driven by a simple AI goal: move towards a target point in a 2D space.

## Project Overview in WIP
The initial goal of this application is to:
- Allow users to control the population size.
- Simulate multiple iterations of agent behavior.
- Visually display agents moving towards a target on a 2D canvas.
- Display real-time stats for individual agents.

The project is being developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles to ensure each feature is well-tested and robust from the start.

## Current Features
- **Population Control Panel**: Set the number of agents and iterations to run the simulation.
- **Agent Selection**: Select individual agents from the population to track their stats (e.g., position, speed, distance to target).
- **Basic Simulation**: Agents move toward a point on a 2D canvas, showcasing simple AI behavior.

> **Note:** At this stage, there are no blockers or obstacles in the 2D space for the agents.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building the application.
- **Angular Material**: UI component library used to create a clean, responsive interface.
- **TDD**: Test-Driven Development approach to ensure features are thoroughly tested.
